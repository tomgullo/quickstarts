Hadoop is great for storing and retrieving files. Here are some steps for storing and retreiving files in Hadoop.

The script below will create a Hadoop archive from files stored on your local directory

#!/bin/sh
hadoop archive -archiveName myarchive.har -p /User/directory hdfs:(namenode):8020/

You may find that Hadoop has a problem with some of your files. It doesnâ€™t like file names with spaces, or special characters like [,( or %. Here is a script that will clean up those files:
#!/bin/sh
find (directory) -depth -name "* *" -execdir bash -c 'mv "$1&" "${1// /_}"' _ {} \;

If you want to view the files in your archive run this command:
#!/bin/sh
hadoop fs -ls -R har://hdfs-(namenode domain):8020/myarchive.har | grep -v ^d | grep -o har://.*
